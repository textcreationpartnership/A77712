            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very thing in the world is a naturall viſion, which wee ought to ſee and underſtand, for the more cleare apprehenſion of the inviſible Majeſty of God, but of all theſe man is the moſt to be admired, being the worthieſt &amp; moſt excelent of all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators works, for whom God made all that was made. There are ſome that hold an opinion that onely Nature was the firſt cauſe of things, and that there is no other God than Nature, but they are eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown if they conſider, That <hi>Prima cauſa quod ſuperiorem non agnoſcat a qua ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſſe acceperit, ipſa ſui ipſius cauſa eſt, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra verò non a ſeipſa ſed a principio ſuperiori
<pb facs="tcp:169835:4"/>
exiſtit, cum enim finita ſit (ut ex Coelorum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu patet) ab alio certè definita eſt, nihil ſiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſeipſum definit, ad haec ſi natura ſeipſum fecerit (quae primae cauſae proprietas eſt) certe ſeipſum fecit naturaliter, quae vero naturaliter fiunt ex praeexiſtente materia fiunt, ut ſi na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura facta ſit naturaliter eam ex materia praeexiſtente fieri oportuerit, quod ſi ſtatuatur natura nondum exiſtente conſequiter aliquid factum eſſe naturaliter, &amp; naturam aliquid fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſe priuſquam ipſamet exiſtent, non eſt ergo natura prima rerum cauſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God made man and all things elſe in the world, and ſubjected them to the power of man, cannot be denyed, and why he did this <hi>Plato</hi> tels you: <hi>Ut a Deo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no opera bona fierent, ſi ergo quaerimus,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>quis faecerit, Deus eſt, ſi per quod, dixit fiat, &amp; facta ſunt, ſi quare fiat, quia bonus eſt, nec enim auctor eſt excellentior Deo, nec ars efficacior Dei verbo, nec cauſa melior quam ut bonum crearetur a Deo bono.</hi> Now although all theſe things were created of divers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and properties, yet by the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible wiſdome of the Creator, they
<pb facs="tcp:169835:4"/>
were apoynted to tend to one certaine and common end, namely, to ſerve man, and in him to ſhew forth the infinite power and greatneſſe of their work maſter. But in man alone the treaſures of his heavenly graces are without compariſon more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unfolded, and that in all fulneſſe and bounty as well in regard of the goods and commodities of this life, as alſo in reſpect of the aſſured happineſſe and eternall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which by the eſpeciall grace of God is purchaſed and aſſured to him only in the immortality of the ſecond life.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as every Countrey is not furniſhed with all ſorts of things (God having ſo diſpoſed thereof) that ſome ſhould abound with thoſe things which others greatly want and ſtand in need of, the omnipotent providence hath taught us the means of tranſporting by water from one countrey to another, with ſmall loſs, trouble, &amp; charges, ſo that one Nation may communicate thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which the Creator hath beſtowed upon them all, each granting mutual help
<pb facs="tcp:169835:5"/>
to the other by this meanes.</p>
            <p>Now this great maſter-piece of the Creator, the beſt part of nothing, for whom all theſe were made, through his diſobedience, pride, ambition, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, incredulity, curioſity, from whence proceeded originall ſinne, and that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption of mankinde, as from a fountaine flowed all bad inclinations, and actuall tranſgreſſions which cauſe our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall calamities inflicted upon us for our ſinnes, and are the impulſive cauſes of all the miſeries attending man; theſe cauſe the privation and deſtruction of Gods image, the cauſe of death and diſeaſes, of all temporall and eternall puniſhments; from hence likewiſe proceed the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſes of our infirmities, which are as divers as the infirmities themſelves, ſtars, heavens, elements, &amp;c. and all the creatures which God hath made are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt ſinners; they were indeed once good in themſelves, and that they are now many of them pernicious to us, is not in their nature but our corruption
<pb facs="tcp:169835:5"/>
which hath cauſed it, as an ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher notes to us by a compariſon of thoſe that ſaile in a Ship upon the water, who are not above two or three fingers diſtant from death, namely ſo far off as the thickneſſe of the planks and timber of the Ship is, in which they are carried into the Sea, for if that timber were taken away from under them, they cannot avoid drowning; but we have death a great deale nearer to us, wee carry it about us by infinite cauſes and means, whereby we are every houre in danger of ſtifeling, poyſoning, drowning, &amp;c. and that both waking and ſleeping, eating and drinking, at all times and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where-ever we become. It hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the omnipotent Creator out of his owne meer mercy, and great providence, to give knowledge and underſtanding of the vertues and qualities of the creatures which he hath placed in the world, and of them to compound Medicines to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all ſuch diſeaſes as ſhall happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bodies of this moſt noble Fabrick.
<pb facs="tcp:169835:6"/>
Next therefore to God, we ought in all our extremities to ſeek to and relye upon the Phyſitian, who is <hi>Manus Dei,</hi> and to whom he hath given knowledge, that he might bee glorified in his wondrous works; read <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> the thirty eight Chapter, where you may finde what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect belongs to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, but not meaning every one that ſteals the name of a Phyſitian, for there be many Mountebanks, Quackſalvers, Empericks, in every ſtreet almoſt, and in every village, that take upon them this name, and make this divine, noble, and profitable Art to be evill ſpoken of, and contemned, by reaſon of ſuch baſe and illiterate Artificers.</p>
            <p>You have heard what the ſubject is the Artiſt hath to work upon, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency whereof I would have him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to conſider, by contemplating the Heavens, the Earth, the Seas, and all the creatures therein, their excellency and admirable beauty, which were onely created for the uſe of man, and are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="tcp:169835:6"/>
and preſerved in their being, and moving, by one and the ſame divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence alwaies like unto it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Next let him conſider with what care, diligence, and reſpect, he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelfe towards this noble peece of workmanſhip, and to that end let the Artiſt be honeſt, having a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doing nothing in his profeſſion negligently, or raſhly, which may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive either to God or man; but let him be godly, pitifull, affable, curteous, pleaſant, bountifull, merry, and mild to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his poor Patients, and profitable to the ignorant, not being moved to paſſion by their peeviſhneſſe, but regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly what they ſtand in need of, alwayes having God the ſearcher of all hearts and judge of all actions, before his eyes, who to thoſe that do well, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a good conſcience towards their Patients, will crown with greater and more precious rewards then ever can be had from any mortall man. Let him have his Latine tongue at leaſt, and that
<pb facs="tcp:169835:7"/>
not onely for a little matter of diſcourſe, as many in theſe dayes conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be thought ſchollars, if now and then they tumble out ſome ſhort ſentence of Latine, which they pronounce bad, and underſtand worſe; but let him have it after the pureſt manner, that he may not onely underſtand any Latine Authour, but alſo any Phyſitians Bill, and may be able to write a Bill himſelfe; neither let him thinke it ſufficient to be knowing in the ancient and moderne rules of his Art, but he muſt apply himſelf to handle thoſe things Artiſt-like which ſhall come in his way beyond the old precepts; for we every day meet with new things, and therefore he muſt endeavour himſelfe to gain the knowledge of Simples, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality, and the goodneſſe of them, both by the ſight, taſte, ſmell and touch, to know the good from the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and the indifferent from the bad, as alſo at what time he ſhould gather his Roots, Herbes, Flowers, Seeds, and Fruits, and how to dry them and lay
<pb facs="tcp:169835:7"/>
them up, that they may be kept from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction; he muſt alſo obſerve the due boyling of Emplaiſters, Unguents, &amp;c. to know what medicines ſhall be boyled in Braſſe, what in Tin, and what in Iron, and what are to be ſtirred with iron Spatulaes, what with wodden, as you ſhall finde in divers Compoſitions; let the Artiſt alſo have a ſtrong, ſtable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepide hand, and a minde reſolute and mercileſſe; I mean ſo as that when hee takes any to heale, he be not moved to make more haſte then the time requires, or to cut leſſe then is needfull, but let him doe all things as if he were nothing affected with their cryes, not giving heed to the judgement of the vaine common-people, and idle prating women, who ſpeak ill of Artiſts meerly out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Let him eſchew all bad qualities eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially pride, gluttony, covetouſneſſe, which as they are odious in any perſon, ſo they are moſt deteſtable in Chyrurgions, he being ſo much drawn from his practice
<pb facs="tcp:169835:8"/>
by theſe vices, that he ruines the bodies of many, yea and of divers the ſouls alſo; I would wiſh the Artiſt to be ſo free from the firſt, namely, pride, and that he vouchſafe to do for the meaneſt and pooreſt of people, as much as for the greateſt and richeſt, for they are all alike in the ſight of God; if thou ſeeſt a poor wretch lying in miſery wanting the painfull hand of ſome Artiſt, let him not be nice, lazie, or diſdainfull, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate to the meaneſt creature, as he would deſire others to do to him; and let him not refuſe this in any manner of diſeaſe as fearing infection, but let him go on boldly, in the fear of God, his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling being lawfull; let him encourage himſelf with this, that no diſeaſe is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious to him, that he is bound to viſit the diſeaſed, which who ſo neglecteth, God will finde him out with that diſeaſe or a worſe; and know this that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of thy Patients dying, through thy neglect, their bloud will cry to God for revenge.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:169835:8"/>Gluttony is a vice which extreamly hinders the Artiſt from following his Calling as he ought, being given up ſo much to the exceſſe of meat and drink, that they are not capable of doing any thing that is good: A great many there are who tearm themſelves Artiſts, who minde nothing but their bellies; ſome cannot paſſe away the day unleſſe they begin in the Alehouſe aſſoon as they riſe out of their beds, and ſo continue untill night; ſome think they cannot entertain their friends, nor be accounted good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, nor good company, unleſſe they drink ſo long as they can ſtand, which indeed not onely overthrows their own healths, but the healths alſo and lives of others, who ſending to them for helpe, run in a drunken fit and fall to cutting, burning, and torturing, the poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to their utter undoing, not knowing what they do, nor how to do any thing aright, and this courſe of life is it which makes them ſo ſottiſh, ſtupid and bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, that they are not fit to undertake
<pb facs="tcp:169835:9"/>
or doe any thing about a Chriſtian, yet will they venture upon any thing though never ſo drunk, and from hence happen ſo many evill accidents as are daily ſeen by Patients receiving Phyſick, blouding, dreſſing, &amp;c. from drunken Artiſts; as convulſions, palſies, pricking of nerves, diſtempers in wounds, and from thence feavers, and death it ſelf. And this many will not be ſenſible of, but if they ſtand in need of the Artiſts help they finde him at the Alehouſe, where his diſcourſe is ſcurrility, his <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> a pot of Ale; and to the firſt demand, he anſwers with three or four great oaths, and ſpeaks high with ſome ſtrange tearms, neither underſtood by his Patient, nor himſelf, enough to fright him; O that's a brave man, a learned man, I warrant him, and ready in his work! when indeed he is skilfull in nothing but unskilfulneſſe; for how can a man expect any good from him who ſpends his time in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? whereas our ancient Chyrurgions laboured day and night to attaine to the
<pb facs="tcp:169835:9"/>
perfection of the Art, as diligently as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Nullus mihi per otium dies exit, partem noctis ſtudiis dedico, non vero ſomno ſed oculos vigilia fatigatos, cadenteſque in operam detineo;</hi> yet could gain the depth of it. And this let the Artiſt obſerve, that though he be ever learning, yet he ſhall never learn half of that he ought to know, for <hi>vita brevis ars longa,</hi> let him therefore follow his practice and ſtudy, laying aſide the pot and pipe, which will but render him odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and contemptible in the ſight of God and man, and unapt and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to proſecute any good thing, either in his Calling, or otherwiſe; I need not herein inlarge my ſelfe, what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, is too well known, I will onely give you the true deſcription of them in a few words, <hi>Atlantes videri volunt, quum ſint ſtatuae lapideae, fungi forſan &amp; bardi, nihil a ſaxo differentes, viles ſcurrae, idiotae, circumforanei, vagi aſini, praeter in verecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum frontem adferentes nihil, vulgares quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam quiſquilius &amp; ſcholarium quaedam nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamenta,

            </p>
            <p>Covetouſneſſe is as ill beſeeming an Artiſt as any other vice, being the root of all evills; from it ariſe all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieves in the world, quarrels, ſtrifes, ſuits, hatred, envy, thefts, polings, ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, wars, murders, poyſonings, &amp;c. from hence it is that God is forgotten, our neighbour hated, and many times the ſon forgiveth not his Father, neither the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Brother, meerly for the deſire of gain. Truly I muſt needs ſay thus much for my ſelfe, that finding i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo deteſtable in all men, but eſpecially in a Phyſitian, I have (to mine own power) vowed the utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine thereof, neither ſhall I ever be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to it with any perſwaſion, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: <hi>Hipocrates</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Cratena</hi> an Hearbariſt, gives him this good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, that if it were poſſible amongſt other
<pb facs="tcp:169835:10"/>
Hearbs he ſhould cut up that Weed of Covetouſneſſe by the roots, that there be no remainder left, and then know this for a certain, that together with their bodies thou mayſt quickly cure all the diſeaſes of their mindes. <hi>John Maria</hi> Duke of Millaine chaſtiſed very juſtly though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely the Covetouſneſſe of a Curate who denied the buriall of a dead body, becauſe his Widow had not wherewithall to pay him the charges of the buriall, the Duke himſelf going to the funerals of the dead, where he cauſed the Prieſt to be bound to the coarſe, and ſo caſt them both into one pit. And truly I could wiſh that all Artiſts who do deny their help or their medicines to the poore ſhould have ſome ſuch pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted upon them, for it is the ruine of many a poore wrech, who lieth languiſhing, and periſheth for want of means to ſend to the Phyſitian or Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion.</p>
            <p>But be thou neither careleſſe nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Harpey-like, to make a prey of thy Patient by prolonging and wyer-drawing
<pb facs="tcp:169835:11"/>
thy cure ſo long as there is any hope of pay: <hi>Non miſſura cutem niſi plena cruroris hirudo:</hi> But as I have ſaid endeavour thy ſelfe to live chaſtly, ſoberly, and civily in thy converſation, that thou mayeſt be blameleſſe before God and man; let him alwayes give care to the diſcourſes of the Learned; for <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> rule is, that the more knowledge a man hath, the greater occaſion of doubting is offered. Be ſure thou ſearch into the nature and cauſe of the griefe thou undertakeſt, elſe will it be impoſſible for thee to preſcribe a remedy to the ſick party: a diſeaſe known (ſaith the proverb) is halfe cured.</p>
            <p>Never adminiſter any medicine, but firſt make thy ſupplication to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for his Aſſiſtance to thine endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: and whenſoever thou haſt cured any patient, forget not to give him hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanks for making thee the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory in reſtoring health to the ſick. Theſe two are ſo often omitted by Artiſts, that many times they miſſe of their purpoſe, and the divine Art is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:169835:11"/>
ſcandalized; <hi>Multa in homine bona fiunt quae non facit homo, nulla vero facit homo quae non Deus praeſtet ut faciat homo,</hi> ſaith a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divine.</p>
            <p>Preſume not too much on thy own wiſdome and vertue, leſt thou beeſt lifted up with a vain confidence, and puffed up with pride, for when men are carried with an inordinate and blinde love of themſelves they are ſoon perſwaded that there is nothing in them worthy to be deſpiſed, yea they think that their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is wiſdome, inſomuch that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, they ſuppoſe they know all things, and having no dexterity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any one commendable work, they preſume very inconſiderately to ſet their hand to every great matter; but the more care and diligence they beſtow, being led with a deſire to ſhew great skill, and thinking to win honour and renown, ſo much the more they diſcover their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and blockiſhneſſe, purchaſing to themſelves ſhame and infamy: For a man to know himſelfe to be ignorant, is
<pb facs="tcp:169835:12"/>
the beſt ſcience, and ſo neceſſary for men, that without it they cannot be truly skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; for as I ſaid before, the ignorant perſon that knoweth not himſelfe to be ſuch an one, but ſuppoſeth he knoweth that which he doth not, indeed is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable a beaſt as can be. There are held to be two main defects of wit, error and ignorance, to which all others are reduced; by ignorance we know not things neceſſary, by error we know them falſely; ignorance is a privation, error a poſitive act; from ignorance comes vice, from error hereſie. <hi>Socrates</hi> who by the oracle was declared to be the wiſeſt man then living, was greatly commended by the Ancients, becauſe he ſaid he knew but onely one thing; namely, That he was ignorant, and knew nothing. Theſe things being obſerved, I doubt not, but the Artiſt may proceed in his work boldly, and with good ſucceſſe. But I know what ſome will anſwer to all this I have ſaid, they will me as <hi>Phaedra</hi> did her Nurſe, <hi>quae loqueris vera ſunt, ſed ſuror ſuggerit ſequi pejora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169835:12"/>Now a word or two to the Patient: Thou ſeeſt in every Village a ſort of Mountebanks, Empericks, Quackſalvers, Paracelſians (as they call themſelves) Wizards, Alcumiſts, Poor-vicars, caſt Apothecaries, and Phyſitians men, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and Good-wives that profeſſe great skill, go with the name of Doctor, which title perhaps they bought at ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-ſea Univerſity, where they beſtow this degree upon ſuch people for their money; the phraſe they uſe is, <hi>Accipiamus pecuniam, demittamus aſinum,</hi> and ſo with this title of Doctoraſſe, away he flyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Countries poſſeſſing the people with ſtories and falſe tales, and leads them to the deſtruction of their bodies, if not of ſouls too, that an able Phyſitian or Chyrurgion, who hath undergone a great deale of hardſhip to benefit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his Art, can ſcarcely mantain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or know who ſhall be his Patients, and theſe kinde of creatures will give a dram, and promiſe to reſtore a maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and doe it without danger, make
<pb facs="tcp:169835:13"/>
an abort if need be, keep downe their paps, hinder conception, procure luſt, make them able with provocatives, and how and then ſtep in themſelves.</p>
            <p>But beware of theſe kinde of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and if thou needeſt the Artiſt help, finde him out by theſe rules I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed, and conform thy ſelfe as much to him as is poſſible, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be ruled by him, elſe all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours will be to no good end. Be not too niggardly miſerable of thy purſe, or thinke it too much thou beſtoweſt upon thy ſelfe, for in ſeeking to ſave charges thou mayeſt endanger thy health: Doe not conceal thy griefe through baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but fully diſcloſe it, otherwayes thou doeſt thy ſelfe great injury; have a ſtrong deſire to be cured, and a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that thou ſhalt receive cure; deferre not too long before thou ſeekeſt out for helpe, <hi>venienti occurite morbo,</hi> for by this means many times, or through thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in not taking notice of thy diſeaſe, and the danger of it, contempt, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:169835:13"/>
ſupine negligence, extenuation, wretchedneſſe, and peeviſhneſſe, they undoe themſelves, and often out of a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh humour of ſhamefaſtneſſe, they will rather dye then diſcover their diſeaſe; on the other ſide doe not entertaine that fooliſh fancy of aggravating thy griefe, that upon every ſmall paſſion, ſlight im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, or petty impediment, if their finger doe but ake, preſently runne, ride, ſend for the Doctor, and when he comes, all is not worth ſpeaking of; be conſtant to him thou beginneſt with, not changing upon with every ſlight occaſion, or diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him upon every toy, <hi>aeger qui pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos conſulit medicos plerumque in errorem ſingulorum cadit;</hi> again, <hi>nihil ita ſanitatem impedit ac remediorum crebra mutatio, nec venit valnus ad cicatricem in quo diverſa me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamenta tentantur.</hi> I have known thoſe that have been ſo much guilty of this, that when things have not fallen out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their minde, or that they have not preſent eaſe, to run to another, and another, twenty, one after another, and
<pb facs="tcp:169835:14"/>
they ſtill promiſe all to cure them, try a thouſand remedies, and by this means they encreaſe their mallady, and make it moſt dangerous and difficult to be cured. Be not bold in trying concluſions upon thy ſelfe without a Phyſitians advice and conſent; if thou readeſt a receit in a book makes thee beleeve a certain cure, yet truſt it not, for many inſtead of Phyſick, have this way taken poyſon, <hi>operari ex li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris abſque cognitione &amp; ſolerti ingenio peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culoſum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thinke not the worſe of the Artiſt if what he preſcribes work not an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effect, for divers things may hinder the operation of a well applyed medicine. 1. As if the Patient through the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary corruption of his body, and the decay of the <hi>humidum radicale</hi> be come to the laſt period of his life. 2. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt may chance to ſend his Bill to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Apothecary, who through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or ignorance may alter the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. 3. The working of the medicine is hindred by the Patients ſtaying too long
<pb facs="tcp:169835:14"/>
before he ſeeks for helpe, and ſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath got ſo much hold that it hath too much over maſtred nature. 4. Becauſe the Patient obeyeth not preciſely the rules preſcribed. 5. Becauſe every body is not ſo fit to receive medicines at all times as may happen by the evill influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſome ſtar, or the naturall averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the patient. 6. The miſerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and covetouſneſſe of the Patient, who thinks much to give or beſtow any thing either upon the Artiſt, or upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when to ſay the truth, no wages is gotten more honeſtly, nor earned more painfully. 8. Imagination as I have told, is a main matter, for the conceit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Patient towards the Artiſt, will forward or hinder the cure of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. Poſſeſſe not thy ſelfe with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that many have who when they are ſicke refuſe to ſend for the helpe of the Artiſt, ſaying, That if their time be come they dye, that if they ſhall be ordained to cure, they ſhall be cured without the helpe of Art, and with <hi>Pliny</hi> ſay, <hi>Omnis

I ſhall not inlarge my ſelf in diſcourſing the excellency of this Art, nor which of the three is moſt honourable, to wit, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Pharmacy, or Chyrurgery, but only adde thus much, that they are all three ſo depending one upon another, that they cannot be ſeparated, and in times paſt they were all performed by one man, though now pride and idlenſſe hath made them three Profeſſions; yet to ſay truly, whoſoever profeſſeth one, muſt be

skilfull in the other two, elſe he cannot perform his work aright.</p>
            <p>Now a word or two to the Reader concerning my writing this Book, and ſo I ſhall conclude, I know I muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the cenſures of many; ſome will ſay, Why did I publiſh any thing in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue concerning the Art of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that it will not be accounted of any worth, becauſe none will imagine that an Artiſt will publiſh his knowledge in ſo eaſie a way, that every one may be made as knowing as himſelf, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this ſcribling age, when there are ſo many Pamphlets of Phyſick, Surgery, Pharmacy, Receits, &amp;c. thruſt forth every day; as one very well ſaid, <hi>Tenet inſanabile multos ſcribendo Cacoethes.</hi> Indeed I muſt confeſſe, I do venture my credit upon a great uncertainty; but I muſt tell you, tnat peruſing the books that have lately iſſued into the publike, I finde them ſo poor, barren, and indeed nothing at all to that purpoſe, they pretend by their titles, either ſome kinde of fooliſh Empericall
<pb facs="tcp:169835:16"/>
receits collected out of old manuſcripts, or elſe invectives againſt the divine Art of healing, and the ſonnes thereof meerly out of a diviliſh minde, caſting baſe ſcandalous aſperſions upon that reverend Society of Profeſſors, whereby ignorant people are extreamly abuſed; now that I might diſcover the errours and abuſes which theſe baſe companions have hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in theſe times, and withall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>bonum quo communius eo melius,</hi> I have taken the pains to publiſh this Book, wherein I have plainly and truly (though briefly diſcourſed) the moſt part of the practiſe of Chyrurgery in a more eaſie and certain way then ever yet was publiſhed in the Engliſh tongue, and that way which I my ſelf uſed for ſeven years in theſe late unnaturall Civill-wars ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the method of our Ancients, not rejecting their medicines becauſe they were old, and therefore obſolete, for by theſe few which I have here mentioned, being carefull and diligent, thou maiſt cure any wound, Ulcer, or Fiſtula that is

curable by Art, without any new deviſes which many uſe, that they may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by counted famous, becauſe they have ſomething of their own invention which they count beyond any of <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> to the overthrow, and utter undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many a perſon; and therefore I do with <hi>Dido</hi> Queen of <hi>Carthage, haud ignara malis miſeris ſuccurrere diſco.</hi> But you will object, that I might as well have waved this imployment, being it is but <hi>actum agere,</hi> that there are divers elaborate pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces written by judicious men concerning this Art, ſo that what I have written is meerly ſtolne from others, the cream of other mens wit, flowers taken out of other mens gardens: Truly I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but for the moſt part it is, onely give me leave with <hi>Terence, Nihil dictum quod non dictum prius, methodus ſola artificem oſtendit,</hi> ſaith <hi>weckerus,</hi> ſo that I may juſtly ſay, <hi>Omne meum, nihil meum.</hi> I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſly collected theſe few flowers into one bundle, the Compoſition onely mine, and after that manner as never any
<pb facs="tcp:169835:17"/>
yet was publiſhed in Engliſh, though it is the true method of all our Ancient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.</p>
            <p>As for the rudeneſſe of the language, and the ſeverall faults which ſome I know will finde with it; I anſwer onely thus, <hi>Non dubito multos lectores hic fore ſtultos,</hi> and a time may come wherein I may doe as much for them.

learned man Mr. <hi>John Wooddal,</hi> who hath ſet down the vertues thereof at large in his <hi>Chyrurgeons Mate,</hi> whoſe method I follow in this book, as I have before ſhewed; and becauſe the aforſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are too great a price for every one, and in ſuch languages which divers underſtand not, and my deſire being to fit my book as near as I can to the title of <hi>Vade mecum:</hi> I will out of the ſaid Authors, and mine own practiſe ſet down both the vertues, and compoſition of this truly <hi>Laudanum:</hi> And firſt, in all ſharp pains whatſoever hot, or cold within, or without the body, yea even when through, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of pain the parties are at deaths door, or almoſt mad with the vehemency of the ſame; this precious Medicine giveth eaſe preſently, yea and quiet ſleep, and that ſafely, but much better the body being firſt ſoluble either by nature or art, I mean by ſuppoſitory, or clyſter which is better: In the Cholick with Mint-water it eaſeth the gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping pains thereof: In the pains, and gravel of the Kidnies, it giveth preſent eaſe, and likewiſe in the Pluriſie: In pains of the joynts it is very good: It is good to ſtay umes, as tooth-ache, and other like defluxions, in the beginnings, as namely in the tooth-ache, diſſolve four
grains thereof in Plantine-water, and put it into the ear of the aking ſide, and take three grains into the body, and lye to reſt; it is a ſure help: In all fluxes of the belly, whether they proceed of ſharp and ſlippery humors, or

whatſoever elſe offending cauſe, taken with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, <hi>terra ſagillata,</hi> fine bole, or with any other appropriate good medicine, it is exceeding ſure, for it fortifieth the other medicine, and doubleth their forces, adding his own alſo thereto: In extream watchings, and want of reſt either inwardly or outwardly taken, it is profitable; if outwardly you would uſe it, take four or ſix grains with three drops of oyl of Nutmegs made by expreſſion, mix them together, and binde them in two little clouts, and put it into the noſtrils, it will marvailouſly aſſwage pains in the head, and cauſe quiet reſt: In the extream bleeding of the noſe called <hi>haemorragis,</hi> it is an approved ſecret, that ſixteen grains thereof divided into two pills, and thruſt up into the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils into each noſtrill one part, helpeth the ſame: In all kinde of Feavers it is good to be given with water of Wormwood or pill-wiſe alone, and if the heat remain after ſix hours, you may give it the ſecond time, and after that again in like time ſafely, not exceeding the doſe; yet let your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lead you, that where you ſee three grains will not cauſe reſt, in the next potion you may give one grain more, and ſo encreaſe <hi>paulatim,</hi> but encreaſe not but upon good deliberation: In burning Feavers it aſſwageth thirſt, and provoketh ſleep, chiefly in thoſe Feavers in which the party ſeemeth to have ſome ſhew of reſt, with tedious dreams and ſlumbers mixed: In the diſeaſe called <hi>Aſthma,</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:169835:72"/>
and in the Ptiſick, if it be uſed in water of hyſop it will preſerve the diſeaſed Patient a long time: It conſerveth the naturall heat, ſtrengthneth the ſpirits, repaireth ſtrength loſt: It is alſo effectuall to be given to melancholy people, which are void of reaſon, and are troubled with the paſſions of the heart: It is likewiſe uſed with good effect againſt vomiting, and the hickeck proceeding of wind, faintneſs or debility of the ventricle: In the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous defluxions of the excremental, or menſtrual blood it is an excellent remedy with <hi>crocus martis,</hi> or red corral: In phrenſies, and madneſs, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly it is good mixed with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and the temples anointed therewith: In the falling-ſickneſs, with Spirit of Vitriol or the quinteſſence of Camphire, with alo oyl of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond it is uſually taken; but beware you uſe not this medicine to any which are feeble through a great cough, being oppreſſed with tough phlegme, and ſhortneſs of breath, for there it is not good. The doſe is, two three, or four grains; if there be looſneſs of the belly, as is rehearſed it worketh much better. It is beſt given in any occaſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with waters, or other medicines which are moſt appropriate to the diſeaſes, and parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, and yet may very well be given alone in a Pill, which I willingly do, for that the Patient then is leaſt troubled with the taſte thereof; the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is as followeth,

                  <p>THis Inſtrument was firſt deviſed by Mr. <hi>John Woodal,</hi> a very learned man, whom I do chiefly follow in the method of this Book, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in my Preface, and is of more uſe then the Trapan, as I have divers times experienced, and I uſe it according to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Woodals</hi> direction in his book, which becauſe it is not in every place, therefore I ſhall rehearſe his own words whereby the Artiſt may finde the uſe of it, and by practiſe come to gain more knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>It is firſt to be conſidered that the pinne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169835:86"/>
belonging (which is in the middeſt of the head) being placed truly in the Center, be artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made of good ſteel, and that it be triangular alſo, that it be ſharp each way, well pointed, and ſtand faſt in the inſtrument, and alſo that it ſtand no lower, but alwayes ſomewhat higher then the circumferent teeth of the head of that inſtrument do; for becauſe the ſaid pinne in the center guideth the circumferent tooth-headed-ſaw to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the work, and in the agitating and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Trafine with the hand to and fro in this work, the ſaid pin may firſt take hold ere the teeth of the inſtrument touch the ſcull, for the ſaid pinne is not onely appointed as a rule and guide, and alſo as the ſtay to the work; which done, namely when the tooth, head, orbe, or ſaw, hath taken round hold, then the ſooner the better, the Artiſt is to take up the inſtrument to wipe and cleanſe the teeth thereof, and draw out the ſaid pinne in the cen er, the which he may no wayes omit; which done, he is by the agitation of his hand onely to and fro to pierce, and having pierced, as it were half through, he is again to take up his inſtrument, and cleanſe it, and then again to proceed in pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing by the motion of his hand to and fro, untill he have in all parts gone through the <hi>cranium,</hi> which if he diligently regard in the tender obſervant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own hands; I mean, he that pierceth ſhall ſenſibly feel when the bone is penetrated
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169835:87"/>
through on each part, which conſidered, then drawing of his inſtrument, he ſhall finde the peece of the <hi>cranium</hi> ſo removed, fixed with the head of the inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>But note, nevertheleſſe there is a great care to be taken by the Artiſt in the manner of the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and taking out the peece of the fruſtrated bone divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, let him be ſure ever to place the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding head of the Inſtrument that pierceth ſo, that the triangular pinne in the center thereof be ſet upon a firm part of the <hi>cranium</hi> or ſcull, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes provided it be as near the fractured part thereof as may be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Artiſt is to conſider, that as he which pierceth the <hi>cranium</hi> with a ſmall ſtreight head, ſuch as the <hi>Trapans</hi> were accuſtomed to have, as is ſaid, by the giving way of the ſmall ſcrue that faſteneth the head of the <hi>Trapan,</hi> the patients life may be endangered, namely if the <hi>cranium</hi> be throughly pierced, the inſtrument ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſhould ſlip down upon the <hi>dura mater,</hi> as my ſelf to my grief once ſaw; even in like manner he that uſeth a ragged taper-head of a <hi>Trafine,</hi> how ſafe ſoever, may be guilty of endangering his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, if he be not careful in the manner of his piercing; namely that after his inſtrument hath taken hold round with the teeth, if he either leave the pinne untaken out, the ſaid pinne being longer
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169835:87"/>
then the teeth of the inſtrument, he may wound the pannicle <hi>dura mater</hi> before the peece intended to be taken out be pierced through in each part, or that he do not at the leaſt twice or thrice in the time of his piercing the <hi>cranium,</hi> take up and cleanſe the teeth of his inſtrument with a clout, thereby as it were to miſtruſt himſelf, as fearing whether it have in all parts pierced through, or no, or how much, or in which part he is wanting for fear of going too deep, otherwiſe he may kill his patient ere he doth finde or perceive he is through; for a work ſo ſeldome uſed, and the errours thereof being of ſo dangerous a conſequence, the Artiſt, though otherwiſe diſcreet, by omiſſion oblivion, or other improvidence, be wanting in ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation highly worthy of regard; wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth him to ſuſpect himſelf, and be cautions, for that a man can never be too wary in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for although the peece every way may be pierced, and removed out of his place, yea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the <hi>Trafine</hi> head, yea and ſtick to the ſame, yet the Artiſt may by his hand be miſtaken, and think it not to be through, for that the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſticketh as firmly, and as faſt in the place when the peece is out, and within the orb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the <hi>Trafine,</hi> as it did ere it was divided, and as if it had not gone through: hereby if the Artiſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not his intermiſſions by forbearing now and then his piercing, as is ſaid, and ſometimes view
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169835:88"/>
his work, and cleanſe the teeth of the inſtrument ere it be through he is ſubject to go too deep, and wound the <hi>dura mater</hi> by the continued motion of his hand, notwithſtanding the peece of the <hi>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> is compleatly removed, and reſteth within the head of the ſaid inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>Further he adviſeth the young Artiſt to make triall on a Calves-head, or the like ſubject, before he put it in practiſe upon a man; for indeed a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon can never be too fearful of omiſſion, or of over-doing, for hereby he doth often run himſelf into divers inconveniences to his great reproach and damage.</p>

You muſt be ſure to have the tow put on even cloſe and full that when you pour in the liquor, not one drop can come out by the ſtaffes end, and you muſt alſo have a Clyſter-pot of pewter, or rather of braſſe for melting, with a ſpout, the better to deliver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſiringe the liquor without a funnel, and this pot muſt contain at the leaſt one pinte and a half; when you put in the liquor into your ſiringe, you ſhall draw down the ſtaff cloſe to the end, having a cork ready to ſtop the other end, and ſo lay it down till you be ready to uſe it: when you are ready to uſe it, you ſhall pull out the cork, holding the

ſiringe upright for ſpilling, and then ſerue on the head, and dip the end of it in ſome fat thing, and put it up as far as you can, laying it in as even po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as you can, and then deliver it untill all be in the gut, and then let the Patient turn himſelf on his back, forcing himſelf by all poſſible means to keep the medicine given him for one hour if he can.

                  <p>But if you finde ſuch a reſiſtance in the gut, that the medicine by the aforeſaid means will not enter, then with the hereafter mentioned <hi>ſpatula mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,</hi> draw out part of the hard excrements which hinder, and then proceed as aforeſaid to give your Clyſter; moreover many are grown ſo weak, that they are not able to retain the medicine caſt into their bodies the due time, you ſhall then

                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:169835:98"/>The externall wounds are diſcerned by ſight, or handling.</p>

                  <p>If the breaſt be wounded, the air commeth out of the wound, the Patient feeleth the taſte in his mouth of the things applied to the wound.</p>
                  <p>If the lungs be hurt, the Patient breatheth hardly with a ratling ſound, and his ſpittle is frothy, pale, and raw.</p>

                  <p>The Liver and the Spleen are alike affected, when they are wounded, onely the ſymptomes of the Spleen are on the left ſide the Livers on the right.</p>
                  <p>If the Stomack be wounded, there follows frequent vomiting, ſwounding, fainting, and death.</p>

                  <head>The Cure of fractures and diſlocations.</head>
                  <p>Firſt let the Artiſt lay the patient in a fitting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that he may conveniently extend the member, then let him appoint one man to take the end of the member in both his hands extending it by degrees, not on a ſudden and by jumps: let him place another to hold the patient that he move as little as may be; the Artiſt ſtanding by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhall graſpe the fractured part with both his hands, and as the other extends the member, he ſhall with his fingers reduce all the fractured bones to their places.</p>
                  <p>But before he begins to reduce them, he muſt make ready ſuch things as are needfull, and neceſſary for the worke, as firſt a plaiſter of <hi>Diapalma</hi> about ſix inches broad, or ſo big as will cover ſomething more than the fracture, and long enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the member; two cloaths three double of the ſame length, three or foure ſplints armed with Tow, a large cloath lo lay over them, and foure or five lengths of broad Tape; and laſtly a junck of ſtraw to lay the member in, and boulſters of cloth and tow to put in the hollow places, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may lye levell.</p>
                  <p>When the Artiſt hath reduced all the fractured bones, then let him lay on the plaiſter, and two men holding the part ſteddy, let him put on his two folded cloathes, one a little above the fracture,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169835:105"/>
the other a little below, ſo that the edges of them may meet, then lay on the ſplints ſo near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as there may be the bredth of a ſplint betwixt every one: let them not be ſo long as to gaul the next joynts, then put under your Tapes and type on the ſplints gently, neither too hard for fear of gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, nor too ſlack becauſ then the fractured bones may fall aſunder; next you ſhall cover all with a large cloath, and then put it into a junck and bind it on faſt putting boulſters into the hollow places, and then lay the member upon a pillow or cuſhion as ſtrait and levell as may be.</p>
                  <p>Lay all the clothes on very ſmooth, without wrinkle or ſeam, and ſo broad as that the ends of the ſplints may reſt upon them and not on the bare member, and ſo let the Patient reſt in his bed at leaſt ſix dayes, unleſſe there be pain, or any other cauſe whereby you are forced to open it; then you may open it to give it ayr, and ſo binde it up again as before untill fourteen dayes, when you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue your plaiſter.</p>
                  <p>See that the Patient have every day a ſtool either by Nature or Art, and let him have a cord faſtned to his bed to raiſe himſelf by to ayr his back and hips, leſt they excoriate with too much lying.</p>
                  <p>If the fracture be with a wound, you muſt ſo order your clouts and ſplints that you may dreſſe the wound, and not unbinde the member, uſe no unctious medicine near the bone, but dreſſe it, as I have ſhewed you in the diſcourſe of wounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:169835:105"/>You may do well to give the Patient a ſpoonfull or two of the juyce of the root of Salamons ſeal in White-wine every morning faſting during the firſt ſix dayes.</p>
                  <p>As for Diſlocations, the manner of reducing them would be too tedious for my intended bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, I will therefore ſet down ſome ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which will be neceſſary concerning the handling of a Diſlocation after it is reduced.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall therefore preſently anoint the joynt with oyl of Camomile, Dill, Earth-worms, or the like, and lay over it a plaiſter of <hi>Diacalcitheos,</hi> and ſo roul it up artificially, and let it have reſt.</p>
                  <p>Some uſe to lay upon a joynt after it is reduced a Cataplaſme of <hi>bolus,</hi> and the white of an egge, which is very good, as I have divers times expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented.</p>
                  <p>For tumours ariſing in a Diſlocation, whereby the reducing of the joynt will be ſomething troubleſome, to aſſwage them you may make uſe of a Cataplaſme made of oat-meal, and Linſeeds boyled in beer, or water, with a little oyl of Elders; but if the tumour be not above three dayes ſtanding, then if you reduce the bone, the tumour will preſently ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice for this Diſcourſe, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Artiſt as he meets with Authours to his purpoſe, to collect notes of what he findes want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, for if I ſhould ſet down all particulars,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169835:106"/>
I ſhould increaſe my book far beyond the bounds of a pocket book, for which I intended it, that it might be ready upon all occaſions to re-in-force a weak memory.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as upon divers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Artiſt maybe called to deliver his opinion, either of the death of any perſon, or of the weakneſſe and deprivation of any member in the function or execution of its proper office and duty, and to give his teſtimony and report to a Magiſtrate or Coroners Enqueſt which may be a matter of great concernment, I have for the benefit of young Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and the good of the Commonwealth taken out of <hi>Ambroſius Paraus</hi> theſe following rules, to which I have added what I have found by mine own practice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore wiſh the Artiſt to obſerve that exhortation which he gives, that is, That he have an honeſt minde, and a carefull regard of true piety, the fear of God, and love to his neighbour before his eyes, that he be not carried away with favour or affection, nor corrupted with money or
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169835:113"/>
rewards, but to declare the truth wholly and without partiality.</p>
            <p>Let the Artiſt be carefull in the ſearching of ſuch wounds as are brought to him, that he be not deceived in making his probation, but let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be placed in the ſame poſture he was in when he received the hurt, otherwiſe a wound may ſeem by the probe to bee ſmall, when indeed it is mortal. If therefore he be doubtful, then let him ſuſpend his judgement from the firſt day to the ninth, by which time the accidents and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes will manifeſt the condition of the wound.</p>
            <p>The general ſignes whereby we judge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are four; for they are drawn either from the nature and eſſence of the diſeaſe, or from the cauſe or effects thereof, or elſe from the ſimilitude, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and compariſon of thoſe diſeaſes, with the ſeaſon, or preſent conſtitution of the times; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we are called to the cure of a green wound, whoſe nature and danger is no other but a ſimple ſolution of continuity in the muſculous fleſh, we may preſently pronounce that wound to be of no danger, and that it will ſoon be cured. But if it have an Ulcer annexed to it, that is if it be ſanious, then we may ſay it will be more difficult and long in curing, and ſo we may pronounce of all diſeaſes taking a ſigne of their eſſence and nature. But of the ſignes that are taken of the cauſes, let this be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169835:113"/>
an example: A wound that is made with a ſharp pointed and heavy weapon, as with an Halberd, being ſtricken with great violence, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted great, and alſo mortal, if the accidents be correſpondent.</p>
            <p>But if the Patient fall to the ground through the violence of the ſtroke; if a cholerick vomiting follow thereon, if his ſight fail him, together with a giddineſſe, if bloud come forth at his eyes and noſtrils, if diſtraction follow with loſſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and ſenſe of feeling, we may ſay, That all the hope of life remaineth in one ſmall ſigne, which is to be deduced from the effects of the wound. But by the comparing it unto the ſeaſon that then is, and diſeaſes that aſſault mans body, we may ſay. That all thoſe that are wounded with Gunſhot are in danger of death, as it happened in the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Wallingford</hi> in <hi>Berk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If the Patient fall down with the ſtroke, if he lye ſenſeleſſe, as it were aſleep if he void his excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unwittingly, if he be taken with a giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if bloud come out of his ears, mouth and noſe, and if he vomit choller, you may underſtand that the ſcull is fractured, or pierced through by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169835:114"/>
the defect in his underſtanding or diſcourſe. You may alſo know when the ſcull is fractured, by the judgement of your externall ſenſes, as if by feeling it with your finger you finde it elevated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed beyond the naturall limits, if by ſtriking it with the end of a probe, when the <hi>pericranium</hi> or nervous filme that inveſteth the ſcull is cut croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and ſo divided there from it, yeeld a baſe and unperfect ſound like unto a potſherd that is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or like an earthen pitcher that hath a crack, or by a thred holden betwixt the teeth, and the other end in your fingers, and ſtrike upon it as upon a Fiddle-ſtring.</p>
            <p>But we may ſay that death is at hand if his reaſon and underſtanding faile, if he be ſpeechleſſe, if his ſight forſake him, if he would tumble head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long out of his bed, being not at all able to move the other parts of his body, if he have a continuall feaver, if his tongue be black with drineſſe, if the edges of the wound be black or dry, and caſt forth no ſanious matter, if they reſemble the colour of ſalted fleſh, if he have an Apoplexie, Phrenſie, Convulſion or Palſie, with an involuntary excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or abſolute ſuppreſſion of the urine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
            <p>You may know that a man hath his throat, that is, his weaſon and windpipe cut; firſt by the ſight of his wound, and next by the aboliſhment of the function or office thereof both wayes, for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

can neither ſpeak nor ſwallow any meat or drink, and the parts that are cut aſunder, divide themſelves by retraction upwards or downwards one from another, whereof commeth ſudden or preſent death.</p>
            <p>You may know that a wound hath pierced into the breaſt or concavity of the body, if the ayr come forth at the wound making a certain whizzing noiſe; if the Patient breath with great difficulty, if he feel a great heavineſſe or weight, on, or about the midriffe, whereby it may be gatherered that a great quantity of bloud lyeth on the place or midriffe, and ſo cauſeth him to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>el a weight or heavineſſe which by little and little will be caſt up by vomiting. But a little after a Feaver commeth, and the breath is unſavoury and ſtinking, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the putrifying bloud is turned into ſanies, the Patient cannot lye but on his back, and he hath an often deſire to vomit, but if he eſcape death his wound will degenerate into a Fiſtula, and at length will conſume him by little and little.</p>
            <p>We may know that the lungs are wounded by foming and ſpumous bloud comming out both at the wound, and caſt up by vomiting, he is vexed with a ſhortneſſe of breath, and a pain in his ſides.</p>
            <p>We may perceive the heart to be wounded by the abundance of bloud that commeth out at the wound, by the trembling of all the whole body by the faint and ſmall pulſe, paleneſſe of the face,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169835:115"/>
cold ſweat, with often ſwounding, coldneſſe of the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eam parts, and ſudden death.</p>
            <p>When the Midriffe (which the Latines call <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphragma</hi> is wounded, the Patient feeleth a great weight in that place, he raveth and talketh idely, he is troubled with ſhortneſſe of wind, a cough and fit of grievous paine, and drawing of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralls upwards. Wherefore when all theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents appear, we may certainly pronounce that death is at hand.</p>
            <p>Death appeareth ſuddenly by a wound of the hollow veyne, or the great Artery, by reaſon of the great and violent evacuation of bloud and ſpirits, whereby the functions of the heart and lungs are ſtopped and hindred.</p>
            <p>The marrow of the backbone being pierced, the Patient is aſſaulted with a Palſie, or Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion very ſuddenly, and ſenſe and motion faileth in the parts beneath it, the excrements are either evacuated againſt the Patients will or altogether ſtopped, the inteſtines putrifie and rot, and death ſuddenly follows.</p>
            <p>When the Liver is wounded, much bloud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out at the wound, and pricking pain diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelfe even unto the ſword like griſtle, which hath its ſcituation at the lower end of the breaſt bone called <hi>Sternon,</hi> the bloud that falleth from thence downe into the inteſtines, doth oftentimes infer moſt maligne accidents, yea and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:169835:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>When the ſtomach is wounded, the meat and drink come out at the wound, there followeth a vomiting of pure choler, then commeth ſweating and coldneſſe of the extreame parts, and therefore we ought to prognoſticate death to follow.</p>
            <p>When the Milt or Spleen is wounded, black and groſſ bloud cometh out at the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the patient wil be very thirſty, with pain on the left ſide, and the bloud breaks forth into the belly, and there putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying cauſeth moſt maligne and grievous accidents, and oftentimes death to follow.</p>
            <p>When the guts are wounded, the whole body is griped and pained, the excrements come out at the wound, whereat alſo oftentimes the guts break forth with great violence.</p>
            <p>When the reins or kidneys are wounded, the patient will have great pain in making his urine, and the bloud commeth out together therewith, the pain commmeth down even unto the groyn, yard, and leſticles.</p>
            <p>When the bladder and Ureters are wounded, the pain goeth even unto the entrails, the parts all about, and belonging to the groyne are diſtended, the urine is bloudy that is made, and the ſame alſo oftentimes commeth out at the wound.</p>
            <p>When the womb is wounded, the bloud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out at the privities, and all other accidents appeare, like as when the bladder is wounded.</p>
            <p>When the ſinews are pricked or cut halfe aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169835:116"/>
there is great pain in the affected place, and there followeth a ſudden inflammation, flux, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe, Feaver, Convulſion, and oftentimes a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, or mortification of the part, whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth death unleſſe it be ſpeedily prevented.</p>
            <p>If a Nurſe through drowſineſſe or negligence, lies upon her infant being in bed with her, and ſo ſtifles or ſmothers it to death, which we call over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying; if the judgement and opinion of the artiſt be required, whether it dyed by default of the Nurſe, or by ſome violent diſeaſe lurking in the body, theſe rules following ſhall ſhew the truth of the matter.</p>
            <p>If the infant were in good health before, if he were not froward nor crying, if his mouth and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthrils now being dead, be moyſtned or bedewed with a certain foame or froath, if his face be not pale, but of a violet or purple colour, if when the body is opened, the lungs be found ſwoln and puffed up, as it were with a certain vaporous foam, and all the other intrails ſound; it is a token that the infant was ſtifled, ſmothered, or ſtrangled by ſome outward violence,</p>
            <p>If the body or dead corps of a man be found ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the field, or houſe alone, and it be queſtioned whether he were ſlaine by lightning or ſome other violent death, theſe ſignes following will ſhew the certainty thereof.</p>
            <p>For every body that is blaſted, or ſtricken with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169835:116"/>
lightning, doth caſt forth or breath out an unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtinking, or ſulphureous ſmell, ſo that the Birds, or Fowls of the aire, nor dogs will not once touch it, much leſſe prey or feed on it; the part that was ſtricken oftentimes ſound, and without any wound but if you ſearch it well, you ſhall find the bones under the skin to be bruiſed, broken, or ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in pieces.</p>
            <p>But if the lightning hath pierced into the body which making a wound therein (according to the judgement of PLINY) the wounded part is far colder than all the reſt of the body. For lightning driveth the moſt thin and fiery ayre before it, and ſtriketh it into the body with great violence, by the force whereof the heat that was in the part is ſoon diſperſed, waſted and conſumed, Lightning doth alwayes leave ſome impreſſion, ſigne of ſome fire, either by uſtion or blackneſſe; for no light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is without fire.</p>
            <p>Moreover whereas all other living creatures, when they are ſtricken with lightning fall on the contrary ſide, only man falleth on the affected ſide, if he be not turned with violence toward the coaſt or region from whence the lightning came.</p>
            <p>If a man be ſtricken with lightning while he is aſleep, he will be found with eyes open: contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, if he be ſtricken while he is awake, his eyes will be cloſed (as PLINNY writes)</p>
            <p>Alſo it may be inquired in judgement, whether
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169835:117"/>
any that is dead and wounded, received theſe wounds alive or dead, Truly the wounds that are made on a living man if he dye of them, after his death will appeare red and bloudy, with the ſides or edges ſwoln or pale round about: contrariwiſe, thoſe that are made in a dead man, will be neither red, bloudy, ſwollne, nor puffed up; for all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and functions of life in the body do ceaſe and fall together by death; ſo that thenceforth no ſpirits nor bloud can be ſent, or flow unto the wounded place. Therefore by theſe ſignes which ſhall appeare, it may be declared that he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded dead or alive.</p>
            <p>The like queſtion may come in judgement when a man is found hanged, whether he were hanged dead, or alive. Therefore if he were hanged alive, the impreſſion or print of the rope will appear red, pale, or black, and the skin round about it will be contracted or wrinkled, by reaſon of the compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which the cord hath made; alſo oftentimes the head of the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> is rent and torne, and the ſecond ſpondile, and the neck luxated or moved out of his place: alſo the legs and armes will be pale, by reaſon of the violent and ſudden ſuffocation of the ſpirits: moreover, there wilbe a foam about his mouth, and a foamy and filthy matter hanging out at his noſthrils, being ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both by reaſon that the Lungs are ſuddenly heated and ſuffocated, as alſo by the convulſive
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169835:117"/>
concuſſion of the brain, like as it were in the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſickneſſe. Contrariwiſe, if he be hanged dead, none of theſe ſignes appeare; for neither the print of the rope appears red or pale, but of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as the other parts of the body are, becauſe in dead men the bloud and ſpirits doe not ſlew to the grieved parts.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever is found dead in the waters, you ſhall know whether they wore thrown into the water alive or dead, by theſe following ſignes. All the belly of him that was thrown in alive, will be ſwoln and puffed up by reaſon of the water that is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntained therein; certain clammy excrements come out at his mouth and noſthrils, the ends of his fingers will be worne and excoriated, becauſe that he dyed ſtriving and ſcraping in the bottome of the River ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>king ſome what whereon he might take hold to ſave himſelfe from drowning. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, if he be thrown into the waters being dead before, his belly will not be ſwoln, becauſe that in a dead man all the paſſages and conduits of the body, do fall together, and are ſtopped and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and for that a dead man breaths not, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth no foame nor filthy matter about his mouth and noſe and much leſſe can the skin of the tops of his fingers be rubbed off, for man is already dead, he cannot ſtrive againſt death.</p>
            <p>But as concerning the bodies of thoſe that are drowned, thoſe that ſwim on the upper part of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169835:118"/>
water being ſwoln or puffed up, they are not ſo by reaſon of the water that is contained in the belly, but by reaſon of a certain vapor, into which a great portion of the humors of the body are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the efficacy of the putrifying heat: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſwelling appeareth not in all men which do periſh, or elſe are caſt out into the waters, but in them which are corrupted with the filthineſſe or muddineſſe of the water long time after they were drowned, and are caſt on the ſhore.</p>
            <p>Many are ſtifled and ſuffocated by burning Charcoals in a cloſe roome, and ſometimes reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, if taken in time, elſe quite ſmothered. Theſe you ſhall perceive their faces wan and pale, no pulſe beating, all the extream parts cold, ſpeech and motion ceaſe, ſo that there is little hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, onely as thus, put your hand to the region of the heart, and if you finde any heat and pulſation, then there is life remaining, elſe not, therefore if your judgement be required concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any perſons found dead in any cloſe roome, you ſhall enquire whether there were any Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coals burned there, or obſerve whether the walls or flours be new whitelimed, and the cauſe of their deaths will appear.</p>
            <p>You ſhall know that a perſon is poyſoned, when as he complains of a great heavineſſe of his whole body ſo that he is weary of himſelf; when as ſome horrid and loathſome taſte ſweats out from
